- To start

  cd $HOME
  mkdir -p PLAY/t-opticalflow
  cd PLAY/t-opticalflow
  git clone /project/at073-elderfall/play/t-opticalflow/C++

- To build

  make

- To run

  ./run.sh

  Sample output in output.txt

- t-opticalflow.cpp

  Examples demonstrating usage.

  Provides uniform access to DualTVL1, Brox, Farneback, PyrLK

  In a way, we also implemented named arguments to provide a
  smoother transition to Python.

- opticalflow.h

  The interface is implemented in CALLs.

  Ver 1: takes prev & next images.
  Ver 2: takes a vector of images (see usage in t-opticalflow.cpp)

- Python interface inside PYBIND.

  The usage will mirror that in the C++ example (t-opticalflow.cpp)

  Copy _opticalflow.so to ../Python/Outil/
